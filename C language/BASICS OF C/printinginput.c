/*
Some other format specifiers are
%d: Used for signed decimal integers. Example: 42 or -42.
%f: Used for floating-point numbers in standard decimal notation. Example: 3.141593
%c: Used to print a single character. Example: 'A'.
%s: Used to print a null-terminated string. Example: "Hello"
%0.2f formats a floating-point number with 2 decimal places after the number
l: Long integer. Example: %ld for long.
